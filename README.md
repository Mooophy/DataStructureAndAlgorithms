# DataStructureAndAlgorithms
Common data structures and algorithms implementation using c#
For data structures I will mostly implement generic data structures, provides typical mothods provided by official generic collections
Basicly each structure and algorithms will come with a practical task to test its functionality

List of Structures been implemented
1, LList<T>
  -a generic singly linked list, contains _head and _tail pointers
  
List of practices
1, MatrixOperation
  -to test LList<T>
  -stores sparse matrix into linked list, ignore 0 values so it saves a lot of memory. Also performs addition of 2 matrices.
